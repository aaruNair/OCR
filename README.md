SUBJECT: To develop an OCR

The Google Cloud Vision API allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, and Optical character recognition (OCR). To use this, we will use the python wrapper for Google's tesseract. Supported by Pillow and Leptonica imagining libraries, this will allow us to pull and use images not only taken from the camera but those stored as well. JPEG, PNG, bimp, gif, etc are all supported formats for the pytesseract wrapper. This is the functionality we will use in the backend to create the OCR engine itself.

GitHub / Source tree, Visual Studio Code. Python language with PyTesseract as a plug-in and use Google Vision API as a guide.

OCR software processes a digital image by locating and recognizing characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Some OCR software will simply export the text, while other programs can convert the characters to editable text directly in the image. Advanced OCR software can export the size and formatting of the text as well as the layout of the text found on a page. The OCR software decides the results, a detailed formulated OCR software can give the best results.

The code for the project will be written in Python programming language with Pytesseract as a plug-in. Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.

Google Cloud offers two computer vision products that use machine learning to help you understand your images with industry-leading prediction accuracy.
